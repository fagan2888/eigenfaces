# Face Recognition

> EE4-68 Pattern Recognition (2017-2018) Coursework 1

## Getting Started

### macOS

1. Setup environment `source scripts/setup.sh`
2. Activate environment `source .env/bin/activate`
3. Execute script `python src/<name of script>`

## Report

### Eigenfaces

 - [optional] show why PCA works with covariance matrix (Lagrange Optimisation)
 - how many eigen(vectors/values) exist
 - how many eigen(vectors/values) to be used
 - show **eigenvalues** are the same for a. and b.
 - show relationship between **eigenvectors**
 - reason for selecting b. (computational complexity benefit)

### Applications of Eigenfaces

a. Angelos

b. Angelos

### Multi-class SVM for Face Recognition

TBC
